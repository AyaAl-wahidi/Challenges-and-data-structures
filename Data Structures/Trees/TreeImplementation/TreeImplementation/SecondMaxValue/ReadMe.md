# Binary Tree : Find Second Maximum in a Binary Tree

## Overview

This project implements a method to find the second maximum value in a binary tree. The algorithm traverses the tree, keeping track of the two largest values encountered. It efficiently determines the second largest value by comparing each node's value during the traversal.
