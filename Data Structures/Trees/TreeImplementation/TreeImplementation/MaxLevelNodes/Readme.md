# Binary Tree - Level with Maximum Number of Nodes

This project implements a method `LargestLevelValue()` to find the level of a binary tree that contains the most nodes. The method returns the level with the highest number of nodes, starting from level 0 (root level).

## Problem Domain

Given a binary tree, determine which level has the most nodes. Levels are indexed starting from 0. If multiple levels have the same number of nodes, the lowest level should be returned.
