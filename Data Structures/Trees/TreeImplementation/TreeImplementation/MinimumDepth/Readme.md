# Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

## Problem Domain

The **minimum depth** of a binary tree is the shortest distance from the root node to the nearest leaf node. A leaf node is a node that does not have any children (left or right). Your task is to implement a method `FindMinimumDepth(TNode node)` that computes the minimum depth of a binary tree.

## Inputs and Expected Outputs

- **Input:** A binary tree's root node.
- **Output:** An integer representing the minimum depth of the tree.
