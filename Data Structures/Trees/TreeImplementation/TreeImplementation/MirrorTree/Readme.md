# Binary Tree and Mirror Tree Implementation

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of two key operations on a binary tree:

1. **InOrder Traversal:** A method that traverses a binary tree in an in-order sequence (left subtree, root, right subtree) and returns the node values in a list.
2. **Mirror Tree:** A method that transforms a binary tree into its mirror image by swapping the left and right children of every node in the tree.
