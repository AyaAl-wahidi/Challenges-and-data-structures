# Binary Tree & Binary Search Tree Implementation

## Overview
This project provides an implementation of a Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree in C#. The Binary Tree includes traversal methods such as PreOrder, InOrder, and PostOrder. The Binary Search Tree (BST) offers essential operations like adding nodes, checking for the existence of a node, and removing nodes. The goal is to efficiently manage and traverse hierarchical data structures using these trees.

### Features
- **Binary Tree**:
  - PreOrder Traversal (Root-Left-Right)
  - InOrder Traversal (Left-Root-Right)
  - PostOrder Traversal (Left-Right-Root)
  
- **Binary Search Tree**:
  - Add nodes
  - Check if a node exists
  - Remove nodes
