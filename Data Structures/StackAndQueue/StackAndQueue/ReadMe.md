# StackAndQueue

This project implements basic data structures: Stack and Queue, in C#. Both data structures are implemented using singly linked lists.

## Stack

The Stack implementation follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

### Methods

- `Push(int data)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- `Pop()`: Removes and returns the top element of the stack. Throws an exception if the stack is empty.
- `Peek()`: Returns the top element without removing it. Assumes the stack is not empty.
- `IsEmpty()`: Checks if the stack is empty.
- `PrintStack()`: Prints all elements in the stack from top to bottom.

## Queue

The Queue implementation follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

### Methods

- `EnQueue(int data)`: Adds an element to the back of the queue.
- `DeQueue()`: Removes and returns the front element of the queue. Throws an exception if the queue is empty.
- `Peek()`: Returns the front element without removing it. Assumes the queue is not empty.
- `IsEmpty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.
- `PrintQueue()`: Prints all elements in the queue from front to back.
