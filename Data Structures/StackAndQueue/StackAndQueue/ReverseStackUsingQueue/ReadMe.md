# StackWithReverse

## Overview

This project provides an implementation of a method to reverse a stack using a queue in C#. The `StackWithReverse` class includes a method `ReverseStack` which takes a `StackClass` object, reverses its elements using a `QueueClass` object, and prints the reversed stack.

## Problem Domain

- Implement a method to reverse a stack using a queue in C#.
- The `StackClass` should have standard stack operations: `Push`, `Pop`, `IsEmpty`, and `PrintStack`.
- The `QueueClass` should have standard queue operations: `EnQueue`, `DeQueue`, and `IsEmpty`.
