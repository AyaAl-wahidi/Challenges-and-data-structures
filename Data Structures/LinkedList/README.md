# Linked List Implementation in C#

## Problem Domain
Implement a basic singly linked list data structure in C#.

### Requirements
- The `Node` class should have properties for storing data and a reference to the next node in the linked list.
- The `LinkedList` class should have a property `Node head` to store the head of the linked list.
- The `LinkedList` class should support methods to:
  - `Includes(int data)`: Check if the linked list contains a node with the specified value.
  - `Remove(int data)`: Remove the first node with the specified data from the linked list.
  - `PrintList()`: Print the contents of the list in order.

### Ensure your implementation includes:
- A `Node` class with properties for data and a reference to the next node.
- A `LinkedList` class with methods for adding nodes, removing nodes, and printing the list.
- Handle all exceptions that could be thrown during execution.
